I am in my 5th year at EPITA Paris, a computer science engineering school. Interested in deploying and maintaining applications in cloud infrastructures, I oriented my student career towards telecommunications and networks in order to be able to claim SRE/DevOps Engineer positions in my professional life.

I invite you to browse this blog to see the different technologies I have used. Whether it's for school projects or maintaining my personal infrastructure, I had the opportunity to try several software to find the best ones for my needs.

If you see an improvement to be done or an error to be corrected, I will gladly take the time to consider your suggestions. You can make PR on the github repos or go through my email address (available on contacts page).
