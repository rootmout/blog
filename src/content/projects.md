## April 2019 : Cocovoit
Creation of a website whose application is comparable to that of blablacar. The objective is to be able to propose trips by specifying departure/arrival/price/number of seats and to be able to book the trips proposed by other users. Once the trip is booked, a qr code is sent to client and allows the driver to scan it at the departure in order to verify its authenticity. See [Presentation of the cocovoit project](/posts/presentation-of-the-cocovoit-project/).
